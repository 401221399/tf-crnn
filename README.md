# Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network in Tensorflow (tf.crnn)
CRNN model in Tensorflow using Estimators

Implementation of the Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) for image-based sequence recognition tasks, such as scene text recognition and OCR. 
Original paper http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05717 and code https://github.com/bgshih/crnn

This version uses the `tf.estimator.Estimator` to build the model.
